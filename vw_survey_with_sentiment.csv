I was really excited about going to the aces vs liberty game because it would be my first time seeing Aja play being a Aces fan and living in Jersey. The traffic getting to the city was horrendous but that is to be expected but what was not expected was the incompetence of the parking around the corner from the Barclays center. There were 2 people working and it caused a 20 minute wait making my boyfriend and I late for the game. My boyfriend who is a liberty fan and was excited to see the ring ceremony missed it because of this reason. Once in the section there were people in our seats and pretended like they weren t. Once the security got them to leave we were able to sit down. Once seated the real pain began. There were 2 people behind us who couldn t have been more obnoxious and rude. They were yelling speaking badly about every player on the opposing team as if they could do better. It took everything out of me to hold my composure and get through the game. After mustering through that,the wait to receive the car was atrocious. The parking garage didn t have any idea what they were doing,people were walking up while others were standing there for 10 mins and receiving their cars. All around this was the worst experience I ve had at the Barclays and honestly would like a refund of the whole experience. I don t plan on returning here anytime soon.
