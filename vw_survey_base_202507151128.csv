The crowd is great the staff are amazing it is easy to get in and out of the venue. My biggest and probably only complaint is about the team store. It is so compact that it feels like sardines trying to shop. The aisles are way too narrow and way too many people are let in at a single time. It has gotten to the point many days I don't visit the store at all.

I'm guessing people are buying less as I won't engage the next time I come to Barclays.  I'm a full season ticket holder and new(ish) to Barclays - and it has too much automation for my personal taste.

I have been going to games at Barclays for years. I m a season ticket holder. Every time I have been disrespected,it has been by a security staff member. Yesterday at the season opener several people were still hanging around after the game either buying merch,going to the bathroom or chatting. A staff member game by me (I was alone organizing my bag) and began banging loudly on a pole next to me. Staff became clapping hands at us like we were dogs and helping at us to get out. It was unnecessary and felt really disrespectful. The security staff,especially the men,are the worse part of the game experience."

Atmosphere is electric and it s very early in the season. Excited for the games later in the season. 7 pm start time for weekday games is tough sometimes. 7:30 or even 7:15 would make a big difference. Foodservice staff was rude and the hot dogs were cold and old. Paid $40 for 3 hot dogs and a drink at least they could be fresh and hot

That was the only downside to our Liberty nights. She is 7 years old and hard fan of Liberty.

The game and entertainment is definitely super fan friendly not to mention a great liberty win. I must admit I was a little unhappy with my seats. I was under the impression in section 24,I would be sitting closer to the floor not in row 20 which is the second to last row. This was not explained to me by Ian my Rep."

My daughter loves playing basketball and watching women's basketball. We drive in from NJ but it is so worth it and such a positive experience in so many ways. After every game we go to she thanks me for taking her and prefers going to a NY Liberty game over doing just about anything else (including her something with her friends).

The light up bracelets,the little give sways like the limited edition prints,the wheel spin,and the live art installation. I LOVED the half time show. The thought put into the choreography,bringing three generations of dancers together,and execution of the vision of the piece was so good. Ellie was amazing and had great engagement throughout the crowd. Her energy was so fun to witness live. Most importantly,I enjoyed that during time outs or any non-playing time,the hype team and different dancers/people engaged with the crowd. Plus,the Liberty won which was the icing on the cake. I enjoyed this time with my family for my mom s birthday and we will definitely be back."

I bought tickets around 5 pm on Wednesday - just barely 24 hours prior to the game. Due to some personal conflicts,I arrived shortly before tipoff and was in my purchased seat in sec. 202 by the Liberty starting 5 announcement. However,only a min or so in,I was informed that the section in which I bought my seat - again,only 26 hours before - was closed and I needed to go all the way across the arena to be assigned a new seat. When there,I had to wait quite a while for a manager to come and assign me a new seat. I was not able to sit in my new seat until 6 minutes of game time had passed,missing a well over 50% of the first quarter. It seems questionable,and slightly ridiculous that 1) the seats for a closed section were on sale that close to game time,2) this wasn t anticipated before hand with pre-selected seats to move people to,instead making them wait for at least 10 minutes for a problem that could have been solved ahead of time (I work in live entertainment,and use Ticketmaster,so I know that if you care to anticipate problems like this,you can???)"

I was really excited about going to the aces vs liberty game because it would be my first time seeing Aja play being a Aces fan and living in Jersey. The traffic getting to the city was horrendous but that is to be expected but what was not expected was the incompetence of the parking around the corner from the Barclays center. There were 2 people working and it caused a 20 minute wait making my boyfriend and I late for the game. My boyfriend who is a liberty fan and was excited to see the ring ceremony missed it because of this reason. Once in the section there were people in our seats and pretended like they weren t. Once the security got them to leave we were able to sit down. Once seated the real pain began. There were 2 people behind us who couldn t have been more obnoxious and rude. They were yelling speaking badly about every player on the opposing team as if they could do better. It took everything out of me to hold my composure and get through the game. After mustering through that,the wait to receive the car was atrocious. The parking garage didn t have any idea what they were doing,people were walking up while others were standing there for 10 mins and receiving their cars. All around this was the worst experience I ve had at the Barclays and honestly would like a refund of the whole experience. I don t plan on returning here anytime soon. I hope things change for the future because I love sporting events and this is the closest stadium to Jersey. Thank you again for allowing me to speak to my experience and I hope it is taken seriously not just for me but everyone who would like to attend an event here"

I enjoy the atmosphere and experience. However there is a problem getting access to the lower rows of section 8. after leaving the Qatar club. There are no steps leading from the floor to these rows between secs 7 & 8 as there are between secs 8 & 9. You can only descend from the mezzanine level or disturb people in section 7 to gain access to my seat in row 1 of sec 8. I have difficulty descending stairs so I hope this can be rectified.

At age 76 i would expect a little extra help. I would expect to receive the sane little giveaways that other people get rather than someone tell me he has nothing left when i see a bag at his feet filled with the item.  Eventually I got my little light wristlet which stopped working after 2 minutes . I would expect the bathroom attendant to push all the paper towels down into the garbage can rather than see a foot of towels on the floor.  That was disappointing. However i will still cone to games

I was a ticket holder for about 10 years (1999-2008). I had always a great experience and being this was my very 1st game at the Barclays Center it actually got even better. The fanbase grew tremendously and all of the action in and around the arena was electric. The team is destined to become repeat Champions this year,especially with the acquisition of Natasha Cloud. She seems like the new and updated Weatherspoon with the intensity she brings with her."

Most of the items were sold out by the time I went there after the game. The shirts that were available were only available in XL and XXL,there were hardly any L sized shirts,and ZERO medium and small sized shirts. I ended up getting a large,but not the design i wanted. I realize that is because the spectators who showed up for the game were so enthusiastic,and you didn't anticipate running out of almost everything,but given how popular the team has become,it would be good to anticipate running out,and have more stock to begin with.

My only issue is section 212 is ridiculously steep and should come with a disclaimer or warning. I really felt like I had to hold on to the railing as I was walking down to my seat. A bit frustrating as I am a member and I bought lower seats but had to swap and they give you 200. Seats should be comparable to what the member originally purchased. Only gripe I have. Overall the atmoshepere is electric and team is awesome.

I did reach out to the group sales team though because I felt strongly that we were overcharged for the seats that we were assigned. The Group sales department said that it was  dynamic pricing,??? but I must say that as a faculty advisor who wants the best for my students that assigning them to $28 seats when we paid $50 per ticket was kind of a bummer. I thought that working through the Group sales department would get us a better deal not a worse deal. I hope that this is something that your team will take into consideration for future student groups. I only want the best experience for my students as I am sure you can understand. Thank you."

But was blocked.  Trying to get up to second level inside the Barclays arena was so slow.  A long line down the hall.  Trying to exit the stadium was a confusing mess.  I had to ask three employees how to get out.  The signs are bad and not in full view.   I d hate to see an emergency!!!! As an aces fan who was in liberty territory.   Didn t feel comfortable.   Seats in on section 209 are so tight.  I felt scared trying to get out of the isle. I thought I was going to fall.  So tight.

Food options were good. Enjoyed the jerk chicken bowl.Ticketmaster kiosks went awry and no one could scan their tickets coming in. That caused a delay and a pile-up out the door. A lot of unhappy customers particular to that incident. Liberty played a great game! Ellie the Elephant deserves applause for the effort and entertainment.

However,some of the employees could have a better attitude assisting guests. The usher in front of section 31 misdirected us twice. When we informed her of her error,she failed to take accountability of her mistake. Then kept telling us that we need to calm down. At the Buffalo Boss food court,my family greeted the cashier. Instead of saying hello back,her response was,What do you want???? It s service like this that prevent guests from having a good time,when employees are patronizing you at events."

We had been told by Brandon  a season ticket holder rep that these tickets would be comparable to our normal season tickets. However,there were no seats for the children to be able to see the basketball game. In addition,there was no food and drinks which was part of the baseline club experience is what we were told. Upon requesting his help that day he told us that we could go back to our original seats however,we were not able to access those tickets and we re denied entry. I tried following up again with him and he did not respond for the rest of the day."
